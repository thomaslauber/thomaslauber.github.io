My name is Tom, and I am an ecologist who has always been captivated by the complexity and interconnectedness of nature. From a young age, I have been driven by a desire to understand the world around me: Why is that tree growing here? How did this landscape come to be? And what are the unseen forces that make this place so unique? These questions sparked my interest in environmental sciences and ultimately led me to pursue a career as a geospatial data scientist. Every day, I strive to explore the complexities of the natural world and to uncover insights that help protect the environment around us.<br><br>

I am currently a researcher and data scientist at the <a href="https://crowtherlab.com/" target="_blank">Crowther Lab</a> at ETH Zurich. Prior to that, I studied Environmental Sciences at ETH Zurich, and Geoecology and Applied Geosciences at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. Throughout my career, I have focused on integrating information across scales (from satellites to mass spectrometers) and effectively communicating my findings to a diverse range of stakeholders (from businesses & NGOs to the general public). 
<br><br>

In my free time, I love spending time outside, whether it is hiking in the mountains or climbing some rocks.

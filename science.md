I am an ecologist and data scientist who is passionate about understanding how nature works and how we can protect it. I combine my love for the environment with geospatial data analysis to uncover insights that can help tackle big challenges like climate change and biodiversity loss. I am passionate about finding patterns in the chaos, using data to drive decisions that make a real difference for both people and the planet.

## Research

My work in the [Crowther Lab ](https://crowtherlab.com/) has been all about facilitating and accelerating the research of the group. As a member of the data science group, I have helped colleagues with their data and programming needs, from installing packages on distributed computing clusters to scraping data from the internet. The best part of my work is when someone comes to me with an audacious idea, and I get to help bring it to life. As such, I have, for instance, created geospatial mapping pipelines in Google Earth Engine and Python, developed algorithms to delineate forest patches globally at a 30m resolution, or gathered and curated >400 global analysis-ready nature datasets. Recently, I have also started a project to use LLMs for scientific information extraction. 
<br><br>
My research covers topics such as: 
- The influence of biodiversity on non-native tree invasion, and its effect on forest productivity,
- The effect of forest fragmentation and degradation on agricultural yield and ecosystem productivity, 
- The role of forest in the climate system and the feedbacks of climate change on biome stability,
- Remote sensing techniques for monitoring forest carbon accumulation and functional traits,
- The role of human activity in preserving healthy forests and ensuring access to safe drinking water,
- Quantifying the 'debt' of human land use on carbon storage and biodiversity.

I am proud to have played a key role in the development of the [SEED Biomcomplexity Index](https://www.seed-index.com/), the world's most holistic measure of biodiversity. It quantifies the biological complexity of ecosystems worldwide by integrating existing ecological datasets, machine learning, and satellite information, tracking the state of genetic, species, and ecosystem diversity. Currently, the SEED Index beta version is under active development and being tested across several large-scale pilot projects.
<br><br>
I have contributed to the method development, prototyping, and provided support to SEED's data scientists.
